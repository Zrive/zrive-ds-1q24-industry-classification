       "'The Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing crops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural habitats.                                   The establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, or hatcheries.  A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under different tenures.  For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented.  It may be operated by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm.                                   The sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities.  Agricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm owner-operators and tenant farm operators.  Agricultural support activities include establishments that perform one or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and management, on a contract or fee basis.                                   Excluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in agricultural research (e.g., experimental farms) and government establishments primarily engaged in administering programs for regulating and conserving land, mineral, wildlife, and forest use.  These establishments are classified in Industry 54171, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; and Industry 92412, Administration of Conservation Programs, respectively.'"

Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation.  In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation.  However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.

However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector.  Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them.  Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.  Selected industries in the Manufacturing sector are comprised solely of establishments that process materials for other establishments on a contract or fee basis.  Beyond these dedicated contract manufacturing industries, establishments that process materials for other establishments are generally classified in the Manufacturing industry of the processed materials.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                The materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments.

       " BaseNaics(code='42', title='Wholesale Trade', description=\"The Wholesale Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.  The merchandise described in this sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as publishing.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise.  Wholesalers are organized to sell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b) capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office.  These warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise.  In addition, neither the design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers do not normally use advertising directed to the general public.  Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.  Follow-up orders are either vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between sellers and buyers.  In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing business relationships.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account and agents and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others generally for a commission or fee.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                (1)   Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, drop shippers, and import/export merchants.  Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales branches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products, and group purchasing organizations primarily purchasing and selling goods on their own account.  Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse, where they receive and handle goods for their customers.  Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may include integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                (2)   Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on a commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission merchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organizations (acting as agents), and manufacturers' representatives.  These establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular manufacturer's products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers.  Other wholesalers may be connected to a retail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail operation(s).  These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers.  Still other wholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Although, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be sold in single units.  Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services, such as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in wholesale trade.\", descendants_code=['423', '4231', '42311', '423110', '42312', '423120', '42313', '423130', '42314', '423140', '4232', '42321', '423210', '42322', '423220', '4233', '42331', '423310', '42332', '423320', '42333', '423330', '42339', '423390', '4234', '42341', '423410', '42342', '423420', '42343', '423430', '42344', '423440', '42345', '423450', '42346', '423460', '42349', '423490', '4235', '42351', '423510', '42352', '423520', '4236', '42361', '423610', '42362', '423620', '42369', '423690', '4237', '42371', '423710', '42372', '423720', '42373', '423730', '42374', '423740', '4238', '42381', '423810', '42382', '423820', '42383', '423830', '42384', '423840', '42385', '423850', '42386', '423860', '4239', '42391', '423910', '42392', '423920', '42393', '423930', '42394', '423940', '42399', '423990', '424', '4241', '42411', '424110', '42412', '424120', '42413', '424130', '4242', '42421', '424210', '4243', '42431', '424310', '42434', '424340', '42435', '424350', '4244', '42441', '424410', '42442', '424420', '42443', '424430', '42444', '424440', '42445', '424450', '42446', '424460', '42447', '424470', '42448', '424480', '42449', '424490', '4245', '42451', '424510', '42452', '424520', '42459', '424590', '4246', '42461', '424610', '42469', '424690', '4247', '42471', '424710', '42472', '424720', '4248', '42481', '424810', '42482', '424820', '4249', '42491', '424910', '42492', '424920', '42493', '424930', '42494', '424940', '42495', '424950', '42499', '424990', '425', '4251', '42512', '425120']),\n",

Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers.  In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers.  Retailers often reach customers and market merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting of \"infomercials,\" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines.  Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Retail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients.  These include office supply retailers, computer and software retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                In addition to retailing merchandise, some retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation.  For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance retailers, and musical instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services.  As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Retail trade establishments are grouped into industries and industry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria:\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                (a) The merchandise line or lines carried; for example, specialty retailers are distinguished from general-line retailers.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                (b) The usual trade designation of the establishments.  This criterion applies in cases where a retailer is well recognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for example, pharmacies and department stores.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                (c) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires knowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                The buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them from establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries.  For example, farms that sell their products at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture.  Similarly, establishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but rather in manufacturing.  However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are classified in retail.  This includes optical goods retailers that grind lenses, and meat and seafood retailers that process carcasses into cuts.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Wholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general public.

Some of these characteristics are:\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as an online newspaper or a television program, does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form.  A movie can be viewed at a movie theater or through television broadcast, video-on-demand, or streaming services.  A sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, streamed, or sold at a record store.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and the consumer.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed.  Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their production and distribution very different from goods and services.  Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them.  Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs.  In addition, technology has revolutionized the distribution of these products.  It is possible to distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or online.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute.  For instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product.  This capacity means that unlike traditional goods distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product.  Similarly, a directory and mailing list publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and retrieval.  These products often command a much higher price than the original information.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in custom design of software; mass reproducing software or other prerecorded audio and video material on magnetic or optical media; producing live artistic and cultural works or productions; and performing in or creating artistic and cultural works or productions as independent (i.e., freelance) individuals.\", descendants_code=['512', '5121', '51211', '512110', '51212', '512120', '51213', '512131', '512132', '51219', '512191', '512199', '5122', '51223', '512230', '51224', '512240', '51225', '512250', '51229', '512290', '513', '5131', '51311', '513110', '51312', '513120', '51313', '513130', '51314', '513140', '51319', '513191', '513199', '5132', '51321', '513210', '516', '5161', '51611', '516110', '51612', '516120', '5162', '51621', '516210', '517', '5171', '51711', '517111', '517112', '51712', '517121', '517122', '5174', '51741', '517410', '5178', '51781', '517810', '518', '5182', '51821', '518210', '519', '5192', '51921', '519210', '51929', '519290']),\n",

Three principal types of activities are identified:\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                1.  Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities.  Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities.  Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk.  This activity is known as financial intermediation.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                2.  Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments.  Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                3.  Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                In addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                The subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the basis of their unique production processes.  As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by their use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital.  In addition, the way in which these establishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a third basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process.  For instance, the production process in raising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets.  The process of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of investment pools or the underwriting of securities.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Most of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with similar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation.  Industries within this sector are defined in terms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to a particular type of financial institution.  To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial institutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services.  This requires defining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation.  These units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                The output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot be observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the enterprise.  Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production processes may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm.  Activities are more likely to be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services.  The classification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those employing a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation are included in multiple subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone, because these services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, and the extent to which the activity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Financial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the verification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors' accounts, notifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries.  Since these transaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that principally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified in this sector, rather than in the data processing industry in the Information sector.\\n              \\n\\n\\n\\n                Legal entities that hold portfolios of assets on behalf of others are significant and data on them are required for a variety of purposes.  Thus, for NAICS, these funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles are the fifth subsector of the Finance and Insurance sector.  These entities earn interest, dividends, and other property income, but have little or no employment and no revenue from the sale of services.

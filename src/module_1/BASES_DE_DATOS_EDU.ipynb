Specific focus on certain industry subsectors or objectives may limit the diversity of NAICS codes captured. Geographic location could play a crucial role, as regional economic activities dictate the presence of particular industries. \n",

Understanding this concentration can provide insights into industry dominance, regional economic strengths, or the specific research objectives guiding the data compilation.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Certification_Renewal_Date (3,164 NaNs): Not all businesses may require certification, or some may have perpetual certifications not needing renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Address_Line_2 (6,984 NaNs), Mailing_Address_Line_2 (6,888 NaNs): These likely represent optional address details (like apartment numbers), which many businesses don't have.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Website (3,279 NaNs): Some businesses may not have an online presence, leading to missing website information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Date_Of_Establishment (1,134 NaNs): Record-keeping issues or new businesses might not have established dates yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Aggregate_Bonding_Limit (10,426 NaNs), Signatory_To_Union_Contracts (10,741 NaNs): Many businesses may not require bonding, and not all are union contractors, explaining the lack of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Types_of_Construction_Projects_Performed (11,430 NaNs), Capacity_Building_Programs (11,430 NaNs): These could be very specific fields relevant only to certain types of businesses, such as construction, hence not applicable to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Name_of_Client_Job_Exp_2 (2,525 NaNs), Value_of_Contract_Job_Exp_2 (2,618 NaNs), Percent_Self_Performed_Job_Exp_2 (2,832 NaNs), Date_of_Work_Job_Exp_2 (2,520 NaNs), Description_of_Work_Job_Exp_2 (2,549 NaNs),  Name_of_Client_Job_Exp_3 (3,853 NaNs), Value_of_Contract_Job_Exp_3 (3,956 NaNs), Percent_Self_Performed_Job_Exp_3 (4,245 NaNs), Date_of_Work_Job_Exp_3 (3,852 NaNs), Description_of_Work_Job_Exp_3 (3,871 NaNs): This pattern suggests that not all businesses have multiple client jobs or projects to report, leading to progressively more missing data for subsequent job experiences.\n",
